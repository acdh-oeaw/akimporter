# Options: Add options to the end of a line, seperated by comma.
# --------------------------------------------------------------
#
#
# - multiValued
#   If more than one value should be indexed. Attention: The Solr field for indexing must be able to hold more than one value
#   (see also <field>-tags in Solr schema.xml). If you don't use multiValued, only the first none-empty value will be indexed.
#   Example:
#      title_alt: 310$**$*, 340$**$*, 344$**$*
#   If 340$**$* and 344$**$* have a value, only the 340$**$* will be indexed. If you define the rule with "multiValued", all
#   values will be indexed. This would be:
#      title_alt: 310$**$*, 340$**$*, 344$**$*, multiValued
#
#
# - customText
#   You may specify a custom text that will be written into the given Solr field.
#   Example:
#      title: This is my title, customText
#   In this example, the text "This is my title" would be indexed to the Solr field "title".
#
#
# - translateValue (can be combined with "multiValued" and "defaultValue")
#   You may translate an exact value (for non-exact values, see translateValueContains and translateValueRegex) from a given
#   MAB-field to a value you like to use. You need also to specify a translation file with the suffix ".properties". This file
#   has to be saved in the same directory as the AkImporter.jar file.
#   Example to match the first character of the MAB field 051:
#      pubType: 051[1-1], translateValue, publicationtype.properties
#   In publicationtype.properties, you could define a mapping like this:
#      a = Article
#      p = Journal
#      r = Series
#      m = Monograph
#   In the above example, we match only the first character with [1-1]. If you would like to match the first 3 characters,
#   you could use "051[1-3]". If you would like to match all characters, you could use "051[all]".
#   It is also possible to define a default value that is used if no appropriate value is found in the .properties file. Use
#   the defaultValue option for that (see below). Be aware that the default value is not used if the MAB-Field itself does not
#   exist in the record. That means, in the above example, the default value would not be written to the index if the MAB field
#   051 would not exist.
#     
#
# - translateConnectedSubfields[translate.properties]
#   Same as "translateValue", but translates connected subfield values. Also, it specifies the .properties file for translation
#   in a square bracket connected to the option name. For information about connected subfields, see documentation further down
#   for option "connectedSubfields". 
#
#
# - translateConcatenatedSubfields[translate.properties]
#   Same as "translateValue", but translates concatenated subfield values. Also, it specifies the .properties file for translation
#   in a square bracket connected to the option name. For information about concatenated subfields, see documentation further down
#   for option "concatenatedSubfields".
#
# 
# - translateValueContains (can be combined with "multiValued" and "defaultValue")
#   This is the same as translateValue but the match doesn't have to be exact. An Example: In our bibliographic data, imagine
#   we have non-standard description texts for URLs in our 655$e*$z MAB field. Examples are: "This fulltext was digitized by library XYZ",
#   "Link to fulltext", "Fulltext and abstract", etc. But in our index, we only want the have the value "Fulltext" because we want
#   to build a facet field (filter) with it.
#   To do that, we could use a rule like this one:
#      urlText_str_mv: 655$e*$z[all], 655$e*$3[all], translateValueContains, urltext.properties
#   In the file urltext.properties, which must be saved in the same directory as AkImporter.jar, you could define a mapping like this:
#      fulltext = Fulltext
#      Fulltext = Fulltext
#   Every text in MAB fields 655$e*$z or 655$e*$3 that contains "fulltext" or "Fulltext" (please be aware of case sensitivity), no
#   matter if it also contains other text before or after that word, will be translated to "Fulltext".
#   Please be also aware that a space in a property key needs to be escaped with a backslash (\). Example:
#      Digital\ object = Fulltext
#   It is also possible to define a default value that is used if no appropriate value is found in the .properties file. Use
#   the defaultValue option for that (see below). Be aware that the default value is not used if the MAB-Field itself does not exist in
#   the record. Example:
#      051[1-1], translateValueContains, publicationtype.properties, defaultValue[NoPubtypDefined]
#   Explanation: If the first value of field 051 would not match a value in the .properties file with the mappings, the value
#   "NoPubtypDefined" would be used. If field 051 would not exist in the record you try to index, no value would be written to
#   the index.
#
#
# - translateValueRegex (can be combined with "multiValued" and "defaultValue")
#   Same as translateValue but in the translate .properties file that you define, you can use RegEx patterns for translating. This can be necessary if
#   your tanslation has to be position aware, e. g. for encoded fields like MAB 050. In this field you could have an "a" on position 4 (|||a||||||||||)
#   or an "a" on position 9 (||||||||a|||||). Both characters are an "a" but their meaning is different because they are on a different position.
#   Additionally, also in the translate .properties file, you have to specify the field name to which the RegEx should be applied. That is
#   necessary because different fields could have the same character on the same position. E. g. MAB field 050 has an "a" on positon 4
#   (|||a||||||||||) and MAB field 052 has also an "a" on positon 4 (|||a||||||||||). Each "a", even when in the same position, means different
#   things because they are in different fields. That is why you have to specify the field name, e. g. 050 or 100$*a*a. If the RegEx should be
#   applied to all fields of the rule, just use "any". The field name or "any" has to be written before the RegEx rule and has to be separated
#   from it with the pipe character "|".
#   Example:
#      format: 050[all], 051[all], 052[all], translateValueRegex, format.properties, defaultValue[FormatUnknown], multiValued
#   Read this rule like this: For the Solr "format" field, take all characters from MAB fields 050, 051 and 052 and apply the translateValueRegex
#   option. The translation rules are in the file format.properties, which must be in the same directory as AkImporter.jar. If no translation was
#   found, the value "FormatUnknown" will be used (this is optional and applies only if at least one of the 3 fields 050, 051 or 052
#   does exist in the record). The "multiValued" option indicates that multiple values can be written to Solr field "format".
#   In format.properties, you could define the following rules. Please be aware that you have to escape a backslash with another backslash (e. g.
#   \\d for numbers):
#      050|^...a = Microform
#      050|^........a = Computer-File
#      051|^........a = Book
#      any|\\d+ = Numbers
#   Read the rules like this:
#      1. line: look for RegEx pattern "^...a", but only in the 050 field.
#               If it is found, write "Microform" to the index.
#      2. line: look for RegEx pattern "^........a", but only in the 050 field.
#               If it is found, write "Computer-File" to the index.
#      3. line: look for RegEx pattern "^........a", but only in the 051 field.
#               If it is found, write "Book" to the index.
#      4. line: look for RegEx pattern "\\d+" in all given fields (in the example rule above these are 050, 051 and 052).
#               If it is found, write "Numbers" to the index.
#      If none of the RegEx patterns will match, the default value (in our example "FormatUnknown") would be written to the Solr field "format".
#      If the defaultValue options is not used and no RegEx pattern matches, nothing will be indexed, that means that the Solr field "format" would
#      not exist for the record that is processed.
#
#
# - defaultValue[VALUE] (only in combination with "translateValue", "translateValueContains" and "translateValueRegex")
#   You can define a default value which will be indexed in case no other value was found in a translate properties file.
#   Example:
#      urlText_str_mv: 655$e*$z[all], 655$e*$3[all], multiValued, translateValueContains, urltext.properties, defaultValue[NoUrlText]
#   In this example, the text "NoUrlText" would be used if no appropriate value was found in the translate properties file.
#   NOTE: Be aware that the default value is NOT used if the MAB-Field itself does NOT exist in the record (your bibliogrphic XML data).
#   For the example above this would mean that "NoUrlText" would NOT be used if neither the field 655$e*$z, nor the field 655$e*$3 would
#   exist in the record that is processed.
#
#
# - regEx[REGEX] (can be combined with "translateValue", "translateValueContains" and "translateValueRegex" [with or without "defaultValue"])
#   You can use regular expressions. If a value matches the regular expression, the match will be indexed instead of the original value.
#   Example:
#      425$a*$a, regEx[\\d+]
#   The example would match only numbers in field 425$a*$a. If there would be a date like "ca. 1925", only the value "1925" (without "ca. ")
#   would be indexed.
#   NOTE: Be aware that you have to escape backslashes with another backslash (\\), e. g. for \\d or \\[.
#   If you combine "regEx" with "translateValue", "translateValueContains" or "translateValueRegex", the regular expression will be applied to
#   the "raw" value from your bibliographic data before the translating process (using the translation properties files) takes place.
#   If the regular expression does not match, then the original value is indexed to prevent the loss of data. For indexing only matched
#   values, see "regExStrict" below.
#
#
# - regExStrict[REGEX] (can be combined with "translateValue", "translateValueContains" and "translateValueRegex" [with or without "defaultValue"])
#   Same as "regEx" above, but indexes only values that matches the regular expression. The original value will NOT be indexed if the regular expression
#   does not match! This could lead to the loss of data!
#
#
# - regExReplace[REGEX][REPLACE] (can be combined with "translateValue", "translateValueContains" and "translateValueRegex" [with or without "defaultValue"])
#   Same as "regEx" above, but replaces the matched "REGEX" value with the given "REPLACE" value. This could be useful e. g. for stripping
#   charactars of a sortable field (e. g. for Solr field title_sort you would replace definitiv articles like "the, a, der, die das, le, la ...")
#   If you want to replace by "nother" (in fact delete the matched value), just use empty square brackets.
#   Example:
#      title_sort: 331$**$*, regExReplace[\\d][NUMBER]
#      title_sort: 331$**$*, regExReplace[\\d][]
#   The first example would replace all digits (\\d) with the expression NUMBER. The second example would delete all digits (\\d) because they would
#   be replaced by nothing as there is no value between the second pair of square brackets.
#
#
# - allowDuplicates (only useful for a multivalued field)
#   By default, no duplicate values are indexed in multivalued fields. That is to avoid useless data overhead and falsifying search results
#   (a Solr document that has multiple occurences of the same value is rated higher in the search rank). But if a multivalued field should be 
#   able to contain duplicate values, you may enable it with this option.
#
#
# - connectedSubfields[subfield:subfield:subfield:...:DefaultText] (can be combined with "multiValued")
#   Sometimes, a specific subfield needs to have a "twin" value. Imagine the following: We have 3 fields 655$e*$u containing a URL.
#   Then we also have 1 field 655$e*$z and 1 field 655$e*$3, each conaining a description for one of the URLs (e. g. Fulltext,
#   Table of Contents). So we have 3 URLs but only 2 descriptions. The problem is that, while showing the values for the user in the
#   frontend, the URLs and the descriptions could shift in a way that the descripton "Fulltext" would be connected with a URL that
#   is actually not pointing to the fulltext. At the bottomline: There are values that are connected to other values and need to be
#   displayed accurately for the user, and that's why we need the same number of values (value1a - value1b, value2a - value2b, etc.)
#   In that case, you can use connectedSubfields[subfield:subfield:subfield:...:DefaultText].
#   Example:
#      url: 655$e*$u, connectedSubfields[3:z:DefaultText], multiValued
#   Read the example like this: If 655$e*$u exists, and subfield 3 or z also exists, the value of 3 or z will be indexed as a
#   connected subfield value. It will be the value of the first connected subfield (3 or z) that occurs in the XML data. But if
#   subfields 3 or z of the same 655 field don't exist, the default value "DefaultText" will be written as a connected value.
#   The default value is always the last specified value in the list wihin the square brackets, that must be separated with a colon. 
#   The result is that in the Solr field "url", at least 2 values will be indexed. One "master value" (the one from subfield "u")
#   and one connected value (either the value of subfield 3 or z [whichever comes first] or the default value). If there would be
#   another 655$e*$u in our XML data, another 2 values would be indexed in Solr field "url", so it would be 4 values. The result would
#   look somewhat like this:
#      "http://url/to/fulltext",			[= master value]
#      "Fulltext"							[= connected value]
#      "http://url/to/tableofcontents		[= master value]
#      "Table of contents"					[= connected value]
#   We now have alternating "master values" and "connected values" as pairs (1+2, 3+4, ...) that we could use in our frontend for
#   displaying correct links, e. g.
#      <a href="http://url/to/fulltext">Fulltext</a>
#      <a href="http://url/to/tableofcontents">Table of contents</a>
#
#   
# - concatenatedSubfields[subfield:subfield:subfield:...:Separator] (can be combined with "multiValued")
#   With this option, it is possible to "glue" values from other subfields toghether with the main value. Imaging the following XML structure:
#      <datafield ind1="-" ind2="1" tag="902">
#         <subfield code="g">France</subfield>
#         <subfield code="z">North</subfield>
#         <subfield code="x">Paris</subfield>
#      </datafield>
#   It could be that you don't want to index only the value "France" from subfield "g" but also the additional values. You could index them to
#   separate index-fields or into the same index-field as a multiValued field. But if you would like to "glue" the values toghether so that they
#   will be one value, you could use the "concatenatedSubfields" option like this:
#      geographic: 902$**$g, concatenatedSubfields[z:x:\\, ]
#   The result would be: "France, North, Paris"
#   Specify the subfields you want to concatenate within the square bracket. Separate them by colon (:). The last value in the square bracket must
#   always be the character that you want to use for separation. Please be aware that you need to escape the comma character (,) with two backslashes.
#
#
# - subfieldExists[subfield:subfield:subfield:...:AND|OR] (can be combined with all other options)
#   The given subfield(s) in the square bracket must exist. If it/they do not exist, the main field(s) will not be indexed.
#   You can use operators. Use only uppercase letters for operators, they are case sensitive (right: AND, wrong: and, right: OR, wrong: or)!
#   If you don't use an operator, the default is "AND".
#   Examples:
#      title: 331$**$a, subfieldExists[b:c:AND]
#      author: 100$**$p, subfieldExists[z:u:OR]
#   The "title" will only be indexed if field "331" contains also subfields "b" AND "c" (both of them must exist).
#   The author will only be indexed if field 100 contains also subfields "z" OR "u" (only one of them must exist). 
#
#
# - subfieldNotExists[subfield:subfield:subfield:...:AND|OR] (can be combined with all other options)
#   The given subfield(s) in the square bracket must not exist. If it/they exist/s, the main field(s) will not be indexed.
#   You can use operators. Use only uppercase letters for operators, they are case sensitive (right: AND, wrong: and, right: OR, wrong: or)!
#   If you don't use an operator, the default is "AND".
#   Examples:
#      year: 425$**$a, subfieldNotExists[9:i:OR]
#      publisher: 412$**$a, subfieldNotExists[x:y:AND]
#   The "year" will only be indexed if field 425 does NOT contain subfields "9" OR "i" (if only "9" OR only "i" exist, it will be indexed).
#   The "publisher" will only be indexed if field 412 does NOT contain subfields "x" AND "y" (both subfields, "x" AND "y", must not exist, 
#   only then the field will be indexed).
#
#
# - applyToFields[field:field:field] (Can be combined only with concatenatedSubfields. More is planned for future releases of AkImporter)
#   This is a special rule which tells the AkImporter to apply another rule to only a specific field. Imagine the
#   following notations:
#      keyword: 902$**$g, 937$**$s, 942$**$z, concatenatedSubfields[z:h:x:; ]
#   It could be that you want to apply the rule "concatenatedSubfields[z:h:x:; ]" only to one specific field, e. g.
#   937$**$s. If you want to do that, use "applyToFields" like this:
#      keyword: 902$**$g, 937$**$s, 942$**$z, concatenatedSubfields[z:h:x:; ][applyToFields[937$**$s]]
#   If you would like to apply the rule to two fields, specify the second field separated by a colon (:). The rule then
#   would look like this:
#      keyword: 902$**$g, 937$**$s, 942$**$z, concatenatedSubfields[z:h:x:; ][applyToFields[937$**$s:942$**$g]]
#   Please be aware that you can't use "applyToFields" on fields with subfields for the same subfields you want to use the rule on.
#   Example: If you would apply concatenatedSubfields[z:h:x:; ] to 942$**$z, this would not work because you can't concatenate the
#            same subfield "z" from the "concatenatedSubfields" rule with the same main field "z" specified in "942$**$z".
#   
#
# - getAllFields
#   See below "Note on Solr field allfields"
#
#
# - getFullRecordAsXML
#   See below "Note on Solr field fullrecord"
#
#
#
# Some notes on special characters and field types:
# -------------------------------------------------
#
#
# Note on wildcards
# Use the star character "*" as a wildcard. It matches any other character.
#     Example (subfield could be any character): 100$ab$*
#
#
# Note on empty (blank) indicators
# If you want to use explicitely empty (blank) indicators, use the minus character "-". Note that the
# wildcard also matches empty (blank) indicators.
#     Example (indicator 1 is "blank"): 100$-2$a
#
#
# Note on Solr field "recordtype"
# - Field for recordtype should contain "mab" and the option "customText" should be used. This would be:
#      recordtype: mab, customText
#
#
# Note on Solr field "allfields"
# This field contains all values of all other Solr fields except the ones in square brackets (separated by colon).
# It uses a special option to achieve that. Always use it like this and only on field "allfields":
#      allfields: getAllFields[Solrfield1:Solrfield2:Solrfield3]
# We need to except fields because "allfields" is used for spell checking and we don't want to have values of e. g.
# encoded fields (e. g. MAB fields 050, 051, etc.) for that. Be aware to use Solr fieldnames for the exceptions, not
# MAB fieldnames, e. g. instead of 001$**$* you should use "acNo_txt".
#
#
# Note on Solr field "fullrecord"
# This field should contain the full record either as MarcXML or as Marc21. As our data are delivered as MarcXML, we use
# MarcXML. Only MarcXML can be used with AkImporter! To get the full record as MarcXML, use the option "getFullRecordAsXML".
# It should be only used on Solr field "fullrecord" like this:
#      fullrecord: getFullRecordAsXML
